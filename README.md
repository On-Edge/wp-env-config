#wp-env-config

A configuration setup the allows for WordPress multi-environment support by giving each envorinment of config file.


##Setup
_Note:  You can use this configuration on a new WordPress install and on excisting websites._

1. Add the config/ files and its contents to the root of your WordPress install
    (if you've moved your wp-config file to a different location, add the config folder there)
2. Add `require_once('config/config.master.php');` to your `wp-config.php`, right above the `wp-settings.php` include.
    Example:
    ```php
    -- bottom of wp-config.php --

    /* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */

    /** Custom config **/ 
    require_once('config/config.master.php');
    
    /** Absolute path to the WordPress directory. */
    if ( !defined('ABSPATH') )
        define('ABSPATH', dirname(__FILE__) . '/');
    
    /** Sets up WordPress vars and included files. */
    require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php');
    ```
3. Make sure you remove the database settings from `wp-config.php`, those are now in `config.master.php` (see example config in the repo).

##Usage

wp-env-config comes with 3 configs (local, dev, prod) and it selects the environment used __based on the url from which the website is served__ (those are defined in `config.env.php`, defaults to the local config).

1. Add the urls for the enviroments you want to use to `config.env.php`:

    ```php
    if (!defined('ENV')) {
        switch (strtolower($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'])) {
        case 'website.tld' :
        case 'www.website.tld' :
            define('ENV', 'prod');
            define('ENV_FULL', 'Production');
            define('ENV_DEBUG', false);
            break;
    
    ```
    To add an environment with a different name you copy the switch above, change the `ENV` parameter and add a `config.newenv.php` to the `config/` folder.
    
2. In the environment file in question, add your database details:
    ```php
    $config_db = '';
    $config_user = '';
    $config_pw = '';
    $config_host = '';
    $config_charset = 'utf8';
    $config_tableprefix = 'wp_';
    define('DB_COLLATE', ''); 
    ```
3. You're done! You can now deploy your site to your various environments and, if the urls you entered match up, everything should just work :)
